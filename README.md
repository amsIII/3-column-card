## My process

I began with a basic layout, adding the image, title, desciption, and button, and then playing with padding, height, and width to get as close to the design as possible. I then split the original component making a reusable card, and button component.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I was recently listening to a JS podcast (sorry, but I cannot for the life of me remember what the podcast was, if I find it I'll add it here) and it motivated me to be mindful of accessbility. So I did some googling on how to make cards accessible, and the finish product is what I came up with. I hope I nailed it lol.
